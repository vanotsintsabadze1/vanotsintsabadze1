I'm Vano, 19, and I am a full-stack software engineer, having worked with ASP.NET, MSSQL, Typescript & Next.js.

Most of the stuff has now gone to archive and are private.

The projects I'm commited to are almost all work related, therefore there isn't anything open-source that i'm contributing to, however this'll be changed in the future =).
